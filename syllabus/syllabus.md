## Projects
1. **Individual:** RPC (Thrift or gRPC) → Echo service, latency test, multi-client throughput  
2. **Individual:** Hadoop/Spark → MapReduce or RDD-based distributed analysis  
3. **Group (3–4 students):** TensorFlow or PyTorch → Train 1–2 models, show training + prediction, present results, report
