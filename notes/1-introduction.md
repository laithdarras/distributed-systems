# Introduction to Distributed Systems  

---

## Course Focus
- Understanding **trade-offs** in technology and system architecture is a core engineering skill.  
- This course emphasizes **distributed computing, protocols, data processing, and system management**.  
- Final exam will cover **Modules 1–7**.  

---

## Key Topics & Flow
1. **Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)**  
   - First building block in distributed systems.  
   - Tools: **gRPC** (Google’s implementation) and others.  
   - Foundation for building client–server applications.  

2. **Applications Using RPC**  
   - From RPC → **Key-Value Stores** → **NoSQL systems**.  
   - Understanding how storage systems are structured.  

3. **Data Processing Models**  
   - **MapReduce** and **Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)**.  
   - Applied to large-scale data processing.  

4. **Query Optimization**  
   - Expected to be the most challenging module.  
   - Requires careful study and practice.  

5. **Real-World Systems**  
   - Applying principles learned (RPC, KV-stores, MapReduce, optimization) to production-level distributed systems.

## Projects
- **Project 1:** RPC (individual).  
- **Project 2:** Distributed data analysis (individual).  
- **Project 3:** AI/ML model training (group).  
  - Deployment to larger scales may be difficult → **start early**.  
  - Student contact: **Alex Villa** (access to supercomputers for running code).  

---

## Tools & Environment
- Use **Linux** for all projects.  
- Familiarity with **CLI, Vim, shell** is essential for coursework and career skills.  
- Options: Linux VM, WSL on Windows.  
- **Docker** knowledge recommended.

## Summary / Takeaways
- Distributed systems require trade-off decisions in design and architecture.  
- **RPC** is the entry point into distributed computing → foundation for KV-stores and NoSQL.  
- **Data processing models** (MapReduce, RDD) and **query optimization** form the backbone of analysis at scale.  
- Projects escalate from RPC → data analysis → distributed ML. Start early to avoid bottlenecks.  
- Proficiency with **Linux tools** (CLI, shell, Docker) is mandatory.
